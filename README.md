# For-rest-from-Fires-Fire-Detection-Model-using-Deep-Learning-
Designed a CNN model that can effectively classify images into Smoke, Fire, and Non-Fire

Data for the model : https://kh3-ls-storage.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Updated Project guide data set/FOREST_FIRE_SMOKE_AND_NON_FIRE_DATASET.zip

The goal of this capstone project was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification. The dataset used includes images categorized into three classes: Smoke, Fire, and Non-Fire. The primary objective was to create a model that accurately classifies images into these categories, which can be crucial for applications such as fire detection and safety monitoring
